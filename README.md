Flat remix is a pretty simple icon theme, derived from Ultra-Flat-Icons, [Paper](http://snwh.org/paper/), [EvoPop](https://github.com/solus-project/evopop-icon-theme) and [Numix-Circle](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme-circle) icon themes. Its design is mostly flat with a subtle use of shadows, highlights and gradients for some depth.

It has been designed specially in gnome shell 3.22 but it should work with most linux distributions, under gnome, unity, cinammon, xfce, kde, etc.

This theme was made to fit with the [Flat Remix GNOME theme](https://github.com/daniruiz/Super-Flat-Remix-GNOME-theme).
